# Page Audit Checklist

Use this checklist after compilation and before showing a changed page to the user. It turns visual review into an explicit audit rather than an informal glance.

## Build Evidence

- [ ] Compile twice with the deck's intended engine.
- [ ] Reject LaTeX errors and relevant overfull boxes.
- [ ] Render every changed page at `180–220 dpi`.
- [ ] Render `400–600 dpi` local crops for dense or important junctions, multi-edge nodes, bends, labels, graph overlays, group-boundary entries, and tightly placed outermost children.
- [ ] Render the whole deck when a shared theme, font, macro, page number, or common asset changed.
- [ ] Confirm the PDF page count and the location of every inserted or removed page.

## Full-Frame Sweep

Inspect the complete page first, then inspect the top, bottom, left, and right edges at original detail.

- [ ] The title, section label, page number, rules, and footer occupy their intended bands.
- [ ] No title is crowded against the top edge or competing with the page number.
- [ ] Meaningful content stays inside the safe area.
- [ ] The page has a clear visual center and reading order.
- [ ] Empty space looks intentional rather than caused by a misplaced or undersized object.

## Containers and Text

Inspect every container individually, including the first and last card in each row.

- [ ] Every card has visible left, right, top, and bottom clearance from its parent group.
- [ ] The full rendered bounding boxes of the outermost children remain inside the parent group; inspect the first and last child rather than inferring containment from node centers or minimum widths.
- [ ] Peer cards use consistent padding, heights, title baselines, body starts, and corner-radius hierarchy.
- [ ] Text does not touch or visually merge with a border, separator, neighboring block, or page edge.
- [ ] No final line contains a single avoidable word, short fragment, or split technical term.
- [ ] Headings and important labels are not automatically hyphenated.
- [ ] Narrow prose is ragged-right; interword spacing is not stretched by justification.
- [ ] Paragraph leading and paragraph gaps are consistent within a slide and across comparable slides.
- [ ] A tag remains inside its card, contrasts with the card fill, and does not displace the title.

## Connector Trace

Trace every connector from source to target. Do not infer that a line is correct because the overall diagram looks plausible.

- [ ] The line visibly touches the intended source and target anchors.
- [ ] A side with one connector uses its visible midpoint; every offset port has a deliberate multi-edge reason.
- [ ] In local crops, the final segment, arrow shaft, and arrowhead are collinear and centered on the assigned port.
- [ ] The final segment approaches the target from a side appropriate to that anchor.
- [ ] No connector terminates in empty space, stops one or two pixels short, or disappears under a border.
- [ ] Lines avoid text, tags, nodes, group titles, and unrelated containers.
- [ ] Every group-boundary entry crosses outside the group label and its reserved title band.
- [ ] Shared junctions are deliberate; ambiguous intersections are rerouted or bridged.
- [ ] Orthogonal bends occupy named open corridors; terminal stubs are consistent and no short corrective jog remains.
- [ ] Primary, return, optional, and exceptional paths use the documented line vocabulary.
- [ ] Inline labels create a clean line break; adjacent labels have visible clearance from the path.
- [ ] Arrowheads are visible, consistently sized, and not crowded against a node or page edge.

## Graphs, Status, Formulas, and Charts

- [ ] A status label is unambiguously associated with its node by alignment, proximity, or a leader; it is not floating between several candidates.
- [ ] Current state is encoded without a dot sitting on the node border.
- [ ] Graph edges are drawn behind nodes and highlighted movement begins and ends at explicit node anchors.
- [ ] A highlight of an existing graph edge uses exactly the base edge's centerline; an offset stroke represents a genuinely different edge.
- [ ] Formula fonts match the active mathematical type system across the deck.
- [ ] Comparable formulas use consistent color, baseline spacing, and display size unless complexity requires a documented exception.
- [ ] Body text resumes with the intended family, weight, color, leading, and alignment after every formula.
- [ ] Axes, ticks, units, thresholds, direct labels, and annotations remain legible at slide scale.
- [ ] Direct labels cannot be mistaken for another line or data series.
- [ ] Diagrams, formulas, plots, captions, and prose encode the same facts and conditions.

## Feedback and Skill Update Loop

When a user identifies a defect:

1. Locate the rendered symptom and its source-level cause.
2. Inspect peer objects and every page that reuses the same macro or layout pattern.
3. Fix the shared cause when it is genuinely general; avoid accumulating one-off offsets.
4. Update the style or Skill guidance only when the failure changes a reusable decision or audit check.
5. Recompile and re-render every affected page; do not rely on source inspection alone.
6. Repeat this checklist and record the new evidence.

## Reusable Example Stress Test

When changing diagram primitives or review rules, test them on at least one realistically dense page. A useful stress page contains several of the following:

- two semantic groups;
- six or more nodes;
- more than one node shape;
- a decision;
- a return loop;
- an optional path;
- an artifact or checkpoint;
- both an inline and an adjacent edge label;
- a legend or short explanatory panel.

The stress page must remain readable. Complexity is evidence of robustness only when hierarchy and routing stay clear.

## Compact Audit Receipt

For a reusable package or multi-page delivery, keep a short receipt in task notes or `reviews/`:

| Pages | Build | Frame/text | Local crops / connectors | Math/data | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `2–4` | twice, 200 dpi | checked | traced | checked | pass / repair |

Record concrete repairs and re-rendered pages. Do not mark a page as passed merely because compilation succeeded.
